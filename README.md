# CashCrunch

CashCrunch is a elixir application used to visualize revenues and expenses.
It is very tailormade for my personal needs, but could be a good example app to play around with the following things:

- phoenix
- salad ui
- charts.js


## Steps to use it

- `ecto.create`
- `ecto.migrate`
- Start application
- Register new user 
- Login
- Add revenues and expenses
- Play around
